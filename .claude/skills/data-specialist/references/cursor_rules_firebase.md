# firebase Best Practices

Firebase is a powerful Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) that accelerates development. To leverage it effectively, you must adhere to strict best practices for security, performance, and maintainability. This guide outlines the definitive approach for our team.

## 1. Security Best Practices

Security is paramount. Assume all client-side code is compromised and enforce access control exclusively through Firebase Security Rules and App Check.

### 1.1 Enable Firebase App Check

Always enable App Check for all supported Firebase services. This verifies that requests originate from your authentic app and an untampered device, preventing unauthorized clients from accessing your backend.

**✅ GOOD: Enable App Check**

```typescript
// client/src/firebase.ts
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { initializeAppCheck, ReCaptchaV3Provider } from 'firebase/app-check';
// For mobile, use platform-specific providers (e.g., ReactNativeFirebaseAppCheckProvider)

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_
